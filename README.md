# cnn-sentences-classification
Toy project to learn about CNN + NLP.

**Goal:** reproduce something similar to what is proposed in [Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D14-1181).


## CNN with TensorFlow
`text_cnn.py` and `train.py` are written to train the CNN following [this tutorial](http://www.wildml.com/2015/12/implementing-a-cnn-for-text-classification-in-tensorflow/).


## CNN with Keras
`keras_text_cnn.py` are written following this tutorials:
 * A Word2Vec Keras tutorial. [Link](http://adventuresinmachinelearning.com/word2vec-keras-tutorial/)
 * Python gensim Word2Vec tutorial with TensorFlow and Keras. [Link](http://adventuresinmachinelearning.com/gensim-word2vec-tutorial/).
